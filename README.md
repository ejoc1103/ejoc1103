# Hi, I'm Ed O'Connor and I recently graduated Tech Elevator in early October 2024!

### I came into Tech Elevator with an abundance of front end knowledge. Skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs and quite a few more!
### I loved the Full Stack experience at Tech Elevator! It was great to really dig into back end as well as learning a new frame work with Vue.js.  
### Tech Elevator provided me with a ton of new skills like Java, SQL, Vue.js as well as giving me great new perspectives on writing code!
### Now I'm excited to get started in my first Developer Role and learn even more!

## My Skills
